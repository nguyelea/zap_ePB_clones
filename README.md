Data and code for generation of Figure S3B in [Huang et al., 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.20.567784v1).

ZAPS and ZAPL WT inducible ZAP KO 293T cells were treated with doxycycline to induce ZAP expression 24 hours before infection by GFP-expressing alphaviruses. Cells were harvested and fixed, and their percent infection was determined by flow cytometry. Inhibition values in '3fzap_clones_alphavirus_inhibition.csv' represent fold inhibition of infection relative to cells without doxycycline treatment. See manuscript for further details.
